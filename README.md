# ActionSheetPicker = UIPickerView + UIActionSheet #

Well, that's how it started. Now, the following is more accurate:

 * _**iPhone/iPod** ActionSheetPicker = ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIActionSheet_
 * _**iPad** ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIPopoverController_


## Overview ##
ActionSheetPicker
https://github.com/TimCinel/ActionSheetPicker

Easily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutible options. Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.

Improvements more than welcome - they are kindly requested :)


## Benefits ##

 * Spawn pickers with convenience function - delegate or reference
   not required. Just provide a target/action callback.
 * Add buttons to UIToolbar for quick selection (see ActionSheetDatePicker below)
 * Delegate protocol available for more control
 * Universal (iPhone/iPod/iPad)

## Quickstart ##

There are 4 distinct picker view options: `ActionSheetStringPicker`, `ActionSheetDistancePicker`, `ActionSheetDatePicker`, and `ActionSheetCustomPicker`. We'll focus here on how to use the `ActionSheetStringPicker` since it's most likely the one you want to use.

#### Basic Usage:

```objective-c
// Inside a IBAction method:

// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Red", @"Green", @"Blue", @"Orange", nil];

[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Color"
                                        rows:colors
                            initialSelection:0
                                   doneBlock:nil
                                 cancelBlock:nil
                                      origin:sender];
```

#### But you probably want to know when something happens, huh?

```obj-c
// Inside a IBAction method:

// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Red", @"Green", @"Blue", @"Orange", nil];

[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Color"
                                        rows:colors
                            initialSelection:0
                                   doneBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker, NSInteger selectedIndex, id selectedValue) {
                                      NSLog(@"Picker: %@", picker);
                                      NSLog(@"Selected Index: %@", selectedIndex);
                                      NSLog(@"Selected Value: %@", selectedValue);
                                    }
                                 cancelBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker) {
                                      NSLog(@"Block Picker Canceled");
                                    }
                                      origin:sender];
// You can also use self.view if you don't have a sender
```
