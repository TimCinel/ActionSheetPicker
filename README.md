# ActionSheetPicker = UIPickerView + UIActionSheet #

Well, that's how it started. Now, the following is more accurate: 

 * _**iPhone/iPod** ActionSheetPicker = ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIActionSheet_
 * _**iPad** ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIPopoverController_


## Overview ##
ActionSheetPicker
https://github.com/TimCinel/ActionSheetPicker

Easily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutible options. Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.

Improvements more than welcome - they are kindly requested :)


## Benefits ##

 * Spawn pickers with convenience function - delegate or reference
   not required. Just provide a target/action callback.
 * Add buttons to UIToolbar for quick selection (see ActionSheetDatePicker below)
 * Delegate protocol available for more control
 * Universal (iPhone/iPod/iPad)
