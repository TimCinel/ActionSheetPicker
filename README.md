Since the [Tim's repo](https://github.com/TimCinel/ActionSheetPicker) is outdated, I forked from his repo and implement a bunch of UI fixes, crush-fixes and different customisation abilites.

I resolved almost all (60+ pull requests and issues) in Tim's repo, but new updates will be added here.

`pod 'ActionSheetPicker-3.0', '~> 1.1.2'` (**iOS 8** compatible already!)

Please welcome: **ActionSheetPicker-3.0**!

**Bug reports, feature requests, patches, well-wishes, and rap demo tapes are always welcome.**

## ActionSheetPicker = UIPickerView + UIActionSheet ##

![ActionSheetLocalePicker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/master/Screenshots/locale.png "ActionSheetLocalePicker")

Well, that's how it started. Now, the following is more accurate:

 * _**iPhone/iPod** ActionSheetPicker = ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIActionSheet_
 * _**iPad** ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIPopoverController_


## Overview ##
ActionSheetPicker

Easily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutable options. Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.

Improvements more than welcome - they are kindly requested :)


## Benefits ##

 * Spawn pickers with convenience function - delegate or reference
   not required. Just provide a target/action callback.
 * Add buttons to UIToolbar for quick selection (see ActionSheetDatePicker below)
 * Delegate protocol available for more control
 * Universal (iPhone/iPod/iPad)

## QuickStart ##

There are 4 distinct picker view options: `ActionSheetStringPicker`, `ActionSheetDistancePicker`, `ActionSheetDatePicker`, and `ActionSheetCustomPicker`. We'll focus here on how to use the `ActionSheetStringPicker` since it's most likely the one you want to use.

#### Basic Usage:

```objective-c
// Inside a IBAction method:

// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Red", @"Green", @"Blue", @"Orange", nil];

[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Color"
                                        rows:colors
                            initialSelection:0
                                   doneBlock:nil
                                 cancelBlock:nil
                                      origin:sender];
```

#### But you probably want to know when something happens, huh?

```obj-c
// Inside a IBAction method:

// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Red", @"Green", @"Blue", @"Orange", nil];

[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Color"
                                        rows:colors
                            initialSelection:0
                                   doneBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker, NSInteger selectedIndex, id selectedValue) {
                                      NSLog(@"Picker: %@", picker);
                                      NSLog(@"Selected Index: %@", selectedIndex);
                                      NSLog(@"Selected Value: %@", selectedValue);
                                    }
                                 cancelBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker) {
                                      NSLog(@"Block Picker Canceled");
                                    }
                                      origin:sender];
// You can also use self.view if you don't have a sender
```


## ActionSheetCustomPicker Customization

ActionSheetCustomPicker provides the following delegate function that can be used for customization:

```obj-c
- (void)actionSheetPicker:(AbstractActionSheetPicker *)actionSheetPicker configurePickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView;
```
This method is called right before `actionSheetPicker` is presented and it can be used to customize the appearance and properties of the `actionSheetPicker` and the `pickerView` associated with it.


#### Want custom buttons? Ok!

Example with custom text in Done button:
```obj-c
    ActionSheetStringPicker *picker = [ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Block" rows:colors initialSelection:0 doneBlock:done cancelBlock:cancel origin:sender];
    [picker setDoneButton:[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"My Text"  style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:nil action:nil]];
    [picker showActionSheetPicker];
```

Example with custom button for cancel button:
```obj-c
    ActionSheetStringPicker *picker = [ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@"Select a Block" rows:colors initialSelection:0 doneBlock:done cancelBlock:cancel origin:sender];
    UIButton *cancelButton =  [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
    [cancelButton setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"cancel.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    [cancelButton setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 32, 32)];
    [picker setCancelButton:[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:cancelButton]];
    [picker showActionSheetPicker];
```
